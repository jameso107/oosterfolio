# Images Setup

To see the dynamic photo background on localhost, you need to copy your images from the "website pics" folder to the `images/` folder in this project.

## Quick Setup

1. Open Terminal
2. Run this command:

```bash
cp "/Users/oosterhouse/Desktop/website pics"/*.{jpg,png,JPG,PNG} /Users/oosterhouse/oosterfolio/images/
```

Or manually:
1. Open Finder
2. Navigate to `/Users/oosterhouse/Desktop/website pics`
3. Select all .jpg and .png files
4. Copy them
5. Navigate to `/Users/oosterhouse/oosterfolio/images/`
6. Paste them

Once the images are in the `images/` folder, refresh your browser at http://localhost:8000 to see the dynamic background!
